# CSC 121 - Casting

This repository houses a number of code examples that demonstrates the different ways you can cast values in C++. Note, this is NOT a complete list! There are other methods such as dynamic casting that we will talk about later.

You can copy the code examples to your own editor or run them using CMake.
